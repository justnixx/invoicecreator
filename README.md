# Introduction

![Invoice Creator](ui/public/logo.png 'Invoice Creator')

As the name implies, invoice creator is an invoice creator or generator web app.

## Usage

- Visit [https://invoice.nixx.dev](https://nixx.dev/invoice-generator)
- Use forward slash in the address fields to define a line break

Example:

`12345 Your street,/City, State/Country`

During the invoice generation, forward slashes will be interpreted as line breaks.

The result would look like:

<address style="font-style:normal;">
12345 Your street,<br />
City, State<br />
Country
</address>
